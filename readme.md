<center><h2>🚀 SpaceX Launches</h2></center>

## About

SpaceX is a big company running by Elon Musk and they have so many launches that I thinking even they not know when and what happened with the previous launches they had tested.

So you can kill you curiosity here with this app. You will be able to see launches data the SpaceX API give access to.

## Installation

- Clone the repository: `github.com/GabrielModog/SpaceX-Launches.git`
- Access the directory: `cd SpaceX-Launches`
- Install the dependencies: `yarn`
- Run client and server: `yarn start`

### Running individually

You will see the have a folder called `packages`, there you will be able to access
the `server` and `client` project. But have no need in go to the folder and try to run. Instead you will on the root project folder and follow this path:

- run the client by calling: `yarn client`
